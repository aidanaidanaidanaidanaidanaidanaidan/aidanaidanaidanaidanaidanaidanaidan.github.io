## The Pleasure Trap – Book Blog Reflection 07/12/2024

I would like to first say welcome to my website. I look forward to transmitting my opinions on various works, especially books like “The Pleasure Trap” by Douglas J. Lisle, Ph.D. & Alan Goldhamer, D.C.

Let’s jump right in. The Motivational Triad is what this book was all about. It breaks down for us by describing the life of a finch, male to be specific. This male finch would naturally, like most animals, have to search for a mate, instinctively. This is the finch's main “purpose in life”. To achieve reproduction, the finch has to impress other female finches. To do this he must gather “stuff” to impress the lady finch. To jump to the point, the finch has a motivational triad: 
1. To pursue pleasure.
2. To avoid pain.
3. To preserve energy. 

To pursue pleasure would be collecting stuff, eating food, and mating with the lady finch. These things are scarce in the life of the finch so the finch has to go out into the wild to search for “stuff” first and foremost to attract the attention of the lady finch. In the meantime, the finch would search for food. Going out into the wild has dangers so that is where “to avoid pain” and “to preserve energy” come into play. The finch wouldn’t want to be eaten by predators so it is cautious where it looks for food and stuff. It also makes sure it goes back to its “home” to recharge the next day. Effectively this keeps the finch in homeostasis – not too lethargic – not too exhausted, and in effect, this will lead to his ultimate goal – reproduce with Mrs. Finch.

## How This Relates To The Modern Day

Looking at modernity it is clear to see that one could indulge themselves quite effectively with less than 20 dollars. And while this is semantical, it is important to point out, because a 20-year-old with his whole life ahead of him could stunt himself without him even realizing it – effectively leading to the stunting of his bloodline. How though? Let’s break down a more detailed example. After Bob’s simple shift at McDonald's (McDon-olds), he will go home to a house brimming with food, and Bob probably brought home a combo meal anyway, probably eats breakfast and lunch at McDonald's. This person is in a constant state of satiety which means he wouldn’t need to be pursuing “stuff” and his women situation would be fulfilled by the computer if you know what I mean. This leads our friend Bob to never make any progress in life.

## The Solution

This book advocates for a plant-based diet. It details how meat causes cancer, this was found from T. Colin Campbell from Cornell University. His book “The China Study” details this further. I look forward to reading this.

## Final Thoughts

I would remind everyone to remember that pleasure is temporary but the pursuit of pleasure is forever.

Thank you,  
Aidan
