I really look forward to post things on this website. Currently, I will be updating y'all on the books I have been reading and infrequent Blog posts (social media feed). 

Eventually, I will be speaking on concentrated topics that interest me (by viewing books read, you will have a rough idea where I want to go)

"We accept the reality of the world with which we've been presented. It's as simple as that." - Christof, The Truman Show (1996)
